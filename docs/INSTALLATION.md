# Installation

<!-- TODO: write document

  This document should describe what the student needs to install
  to allow working on the track on their local system using the CLI.

  You can include the installation instructions in this document, but
  usually it is better to link to a resource with the official installation
  instructions, to prevent the instructions from becoming outdated.

  The contents of this document are displayed on the track's documentation
  page at `https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/<track>/installation`.

  See https://exercism.org/docs/building/tracks/docs for more information. -->
